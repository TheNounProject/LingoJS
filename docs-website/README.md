# developer.lingoapp.com

This repository powers the development site for [Lingo](http://lingoapp.com), that lives at [developer.lingoapp.com](http://developer.lingoapp.com).

## Contribute!

We've made this repository public so you can contribute to it. If you find a typo, or an error, or want to improve the content, feel free to send us a pull request. Also, if there's anything you'd like to see covered or documented, file an issue and we'll do it for you.

We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as our content backend, so make sure to read their docs if you need help understanding how the system works.

## Setup

If you want to get the site working locally, you'll need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [bundler](http://bundler.io) installed. On OS X you'll also need to have Xcode's command line tools installed (`xcode-select --install`).

Once you have them, run this:

```
./run
```

in the project root to start the server. The `run` script will take care of installing all the needed dependencies if they’re not installed, so it may take a while if it’s the first time you’re running it.

Note: you may find issues with nokogiri when running `run`. If that's the case, try the following:

```
  bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries --with-xml2-include=/usr/include/libxml2/
```

If that doesn't work, check the troubleshooting tips on [Nokogiri's page](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html#mac_os_x)

## Generated Sections

As well as the normal Jekyll processing, there are some areas of the site where the source files are themselves generated by other tools. In particular:

- The API documentation is stored in the [LingoJS](https://github.com/TheNounProject/LingoJS) repo to keep it close to the code.
